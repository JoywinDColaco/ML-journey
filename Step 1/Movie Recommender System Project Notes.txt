1. Its a good practice to glance at the dataset before starting your analysis. We can spot some direct patterns which can be treated as the start point of our analysis.
2. When looking at dataset's columns, always look at it with atleast one row entry. It gives one an idea of the entries of the column containing confusng column names.
3. Always do the following pre-processing checks:
   3.1 Check for null values in columns (if total no. of missing column entries <<< total no. of rows then drop those rows)
   3.2 Check for duplicate rows (remove all duplicates)

Compounded-Code syntax simplification:
1. credits.head(1)[cast].values
* credits.head(1) returns the 1st row from top
* ...[cast] returns a preview of the column (values, data types)
* ...values returns only the values of the column (which is a dictionary)

 2. movies.isnull().sum
* movies.isnull() returns the rows cntaining at least one void column entry
* ...sum returns total no. of rows cntaining at least one void column entry

Questions to think about
1. Why do the numerical columns affect our analysis?
2. How will we add 'release date' in our analysis?
