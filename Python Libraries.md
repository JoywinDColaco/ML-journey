   - Supports reading from and writing to files, particularly for array data in text or binary formats (`np.loadtxt`, `np.savetxt`, `np.save`, etc.).

### Example Code:
```python
import numpy as np

# Creating a NumPy array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Element-wise operations
arr = arr * 2  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Reshaping an array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
reshaped_arr = arr_2d.reshape((4, 1))  # Reshapes to 4x1 array

# Array math
mean = np.mean(arr)  # Compute mean
std = np.std(arr)    # Compute standard deviation
```

### Common Use Cases:
- **Data manipulation**: Efficient handling of large datasets for scientific research and analysis.
- **Machine learning and AI**: Libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch use NumPy arrays as the underlying data structure.

# ast
The `ast` (Abstract Syntax Trees) library in Python provides tools for parsing, analyzing, and modifying Python code in the form of abstract syntax trees. An abstract syntax tree is a hierarchical tree representation of the structure of source code. Each node of the tree represents a construct occurring in the source code (e.g., loops, function calls, expressions).

The `ast` module is particularly useful for tasks like code analysis, linting, code transformation, and the development of custom compilers or interpreters. It allows you to programmatically manipulate Python code by breaking it down into its individual components.

### Key Features of the `ast` Library:

1. **Parsing Python Code**:
   - The `ast` module provides the ability to parse Python code into an abstract syntax tree. The `parse()` function can take a string of Python code and return a tree representation of that code.

   ```python
   import ast

   code = "x = 1 + 2"
   tree = ast.parse(code)
   print(ast.dump(tree, indent=4))
   ```

   This will output the abstract syntax tree representation of the code `x = 1 + 2`.

2. **Abstract Syntax Tree Nodes**:
   - The AST is made up of various node types, each corresponding to a different syntactic element in Python code. For example:
     - `Module`: Represents the entire Python script.
     - `Assign`: Represents assignment statements.
     - `BinOp`: Represents binary operations (e.g., `+`, `-`).
     - `Name`: Represents variable names or identifiers.
     - `Constant`: Represents constant values (e.g., numbers or strings).
   
   Example:
   ```python
   import ast

   code = "x = 1 + 2"
   tree = ast.parse(code)

   for node in ast.walk(tree):
       print(type(node))
   ```

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `ast` module allows you to analyze Python code for certain patterns, expressions, or structures. You can traverse the abstract syntax tree and inspect each node to perform checks or collect information about the code.

   For example, to detect all the function calls in a piece of code:
   ```python
   class FunctionCallVisitor(ast.NodeVisitor):
       def visit_Call(self, node):
           print(f"Function call to: {node.func.id}")
           self.generic_visit(node)

   code = "print('Hello, world!')"
   tree = ast.parse(code)

   visitor = FunctionCallVisitor()
   visitor.visit(tree)
   ```

4. **Code Modification and Transformation**:
   - You can modify the abstract syntax tree and convert it back into Python code. By using the `NodeTransformer` class, you can create custom rules for transforming nodes in the tree.

   For example, you can modify all instances of addition (`+`) to subtraction (`-`):
   ```python
   class AddToSubTransformer(ast.NodeTransformer):
       def visit_BinOp(self, node):
           if isinstance(node.op, ast.Add):
               node.op = ast.Sub()
           return self.generic_visit(node)

   code = "x = 1 + 2"
   tree = ast.parse(code)
   transformer = AddToSubTransformer()
   transformed_tree = transformer.visit(tree)

   # Convert the transformed AST back to code
   compiled_code = compile(transformed_tree, filename="<ast>", mode="exec")
   exec(compiled_code)  # This will execute `x = 1 - 2`
   print(x)  # Output: -1
   ```

5. **AST Visitors and Node Transformers**:
   - `ast.NodeVisitor`: Used for traversing the AST and performing actions when encountering specific nodes. You can subclass `NodeVisitor` to define custom behaviors.
   - `ast.NodeTransformer`: Used for modifying an AST in-place by visiting nodes and optionally replacing them.

6. **Compiling AST Back to Code**:
   - After modifying an abstract syntax tree, you can compile it back into executable Python code using the `compile()` function.

   ```python
   compiled_code = compile(tree, filename="<ast>", mode="exec")
   exec(compiled_code)
   ```

7. **Safely Evaluating Expressions**:
   - The `ast.literal_eval()` function is a safer alternative to Python’s `eval()` function. It only allows evaluation of simple Python literals (like strings, numbers, tuples, lists, dictionaries), and prevents the execution of arbitrary code.
   
   ```python
   import ast

   # Safe evaluation of a literal expression
   result = ast.literal_eval("[1, 2, 3]")
   print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
   ```

   **Note**: Unlike `eval()`, `literal_eval()` is restricted to literals and does not allow for function calls or variable assignments.

8. **AST Manipulation in Code Refactoring Tools**:
   - The `ast` library is often used in refactoring and code analysis tools (like linters) to modify or optimize Python code automatically. For example, tools like **autopep8** and **black** use ASTs to analyze and reformat Python code.

### Example Code:
Here’s an example that parses a simple Python program, walks through the AST, and prints out the types of nodes encountered:

```python
import ast

code = """
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

result = add(1, 2)
"""

# Parse the code into an AST
tree = ast.parse(code)

# Walk through the AST and print node types
for node in ast.walk(tree):
    print(type(node))
```

### Use Cases:
- **Code analysis**: You can use `ast` to analyze Python code for specific patterns, such as finding all function calls, variable assignments, or loops.
- **Code modification**: Modify or optimize Python code by transforming AST nodes and generating new code.
- **Safe evaluation**: Use `ast.literal_eval()` to safely evaluate expressions, making it a secure alternative to `eval()`.
- **Code refactoring tools**: AST manipulation is often employed in automatic code formatting, refactoring, and linting tools to standardize or optimize Python code.
- **Custom interpreters**: Build your own interpreters or tools that work with Python code at a syntactic level.

### Conclusion:
The `ast` library is a powerful tool for parsing, analyzing, and transforming Python code. By representing code as an abstract syntax tree, it enables you to perform complex tasks like code analysis, transformation, and safe expression evaluation. It's widely used in projects involving code introspection, refactoring, linting, and the creation of custom interpreters.
